# Analog Clock

This repository contains a simple, yet elegant, analog clock implemented using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates real-time clock functionality with smoothly animated hour, minute, and second hands.

## Features

- **Real-time Display:** The clock accurately reflects the current time, updating every second.
- **Dynamic Hand Movement:** Hour, minute, and second hands rotate dynamically based on the current time, calculated using JavaScript's `Date` object.
- **Stylized Design:** CSS is used to create a visually appealing clock face and hand styles, offering a clean and modern aesthetic.
- **Responsive Layout:** The clock is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structures the clock elements (clock face, hands).
- **CSS:** Styles the visual appearance of the clock, including hand positioning and rotation.
- **JavaScript:** Manages the clock's logic, fetches the current time, and calculates the rotation angles for the hands.
